                    <h2>How Omelettes Are Formed</h2>
                    <p>
                        The journey of a perfect omelette begins with
                        understanding the fundamentals. It's a delicate dance of
                        heat, technique, and timing. Here's a closer look at the
                        process:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Selecting the Eggs:</strong> Fresh,
                            high-quality eggs are <em>key</em>. We recommend
                            using 2-3 large eggs per omelette for a satisfying
                            serving.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Whisking with Seasonings:</strong> In a
                            bowl, whisk the eggs <em>vigorously</em> until the
                            yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly
                            frothy. Add a pinch of salt and freshly ground black
                            pepper to enhance the flavor. You can also
                            incorporate a splash of milk or cream for a richer
                            texture.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Preparing the Pan:</strong> Place a
                            non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add about a
                            teaspoon of butter or oil and swirl it around to
                            coat the bottom of the pan evenly. The pan is ready
                            when the butter melts <em>quickly</em> without
                            burning or the oil <em>shimmers</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pouring the Egg Mixture:</strong> Once the
                            pan is at the right temperature, pour the whisked
                            egg mixture into the hot pan. Let it cook
                            undisturbed for about 30-60 seconds, or until the
                            edges start to set.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Adding Fillings:</strong> Now's the time to
                            get <em>creative</em>! Sprinkle your desired
                            fillings over one half of the omelette. Popular
                            choices include shredded cheese (cheddar,
                            mozzarella, Gruyère), sautéed vegetables (mushrooms,
                            onions, peppers), cooked meats (ham, bacon,
                            sausage), and fresh herbs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Folding the Omelette:</strong> Using a
                            spatula, carefully fold the unfilled half of the
                            omelette over the fillings. You can either fold it
                            in half or into thirds, depending on your preference
                            and the amount of filling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Finishing and Serving:</strong> Cook for
                            another minute or two, until the fillings are heated
                            through and the omelette is cooked to your desired
                            consistency &mdash; perhaps
                            <em>slightly runny</em> in the center or
                            <em>fully set</em>. Slide the omelette onto a plate
                            and garnish with fresh herbs, if desired. Serve
                            immediately and enjoy!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Mastering the omelette takes practice, but the reward is
                        a quick, delicious, and versatile meal.

                    <h2>What Are Omelettes? <em>A Culinary Canvas</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        At its heart, an <dfn>omelette</dfn> is a dish made from
                        beaten eggs cooked in a pan with butter or oil. It's
                        often folded around a filling such as cheese,
                        vegetables, or meat. However, the <em>simplicity</em> of
                        this definition belies the
                        <em>incredible</em> versatility and global appeal of the
                        omelette.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>More</em> than just a breakfast staple, the omelette
                        can be a light lunch, a satisfying dinner, or even a
                        gourmet creation. Its neutral flavor profile makes it
                        the perfect <em>canvas</em> for a wide array of
                        ingredients, reflecting local tastes and culinary
                        traditions around the world. From the
                        <em>minimalist</em> French omelette to the
                        <em>hearty</em> Spanish tortilla, the omelette adapts
                        and evolves, showcasing the ingenuity of cooks
                        everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you prefer it plain and simple or loaded with
                        your favorite additions, the omelette remains a
                        <em>testament</em> to the power of basic ingredients
                        transformed by skillful preparation.

                    <p>
                        The beauty of the omelette lies in its endless
                        variations. Here are just a few examples to tantalize
                        your taste buds:

                        <dt><h3>French Omelette</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>Known for its elegant simplicity,</strong>
                            the French omelette boasts a smooth, pale yellow
                            exterior and a soft, often slightly runny interior.
                            It's typically rolled or folded into a neat oval and
                            may contain minimal fillings like herbs or cheese.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><h3>American Omelette</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>In contrast to its French cousin,</strong>
                            the American omelette is often cooked until slightly
                            browned and is typically filled more generously.
                            It's usually folded in half and served flat. Popular
                            fillings include cheese, ham, onions, and peppers
                            &mdash; the "Denver omelette" is a classic example.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><h3>Spanish Tortilla (Tortilla Española)</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>This iconic Spanish dish</strong> is a
                            thick, savory omelette made primarily with potatoes
                            and eggs. Onions are often included as well. It's
                            cooked slowly on both sides until set and is
                            typically served in wedges, either warm or cold.

                        <dt><h3>Italian Frittata</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>While similar to an omelette,</strong> the
                            frittata often incorporates the fillings directly
                            into the egg mixture before cooking. It's also
                            frequently finished in the oven, resulting in a
                            thicker, more substantial dish. Frittatas can
                            feature a wide variety of vegetables, cheeses, and
                            meats.

                            It's a common component of Japanese breakfast and
                            bento boxes.

                            coriander, and various spices. It's often served
