                    <h2>A World of Omelettes: Discover Your Favorite</h2>
                    <p>
                        The beauty of the omelette lies in its endless
                        variations. Here are just a few examples to tantalize
                        your taste buds:

                        <dt><h3>French Omelette</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>Known for its elegant simplicity,</strong>
                            the French omelette boasts a smooth, pale yellow
                            exterior and a soft, often slightly runny interior.
                            It's typically rolled or folded into a neat oval and
                            may contain minimal fillings like herbs or cheese.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><h3>American Omelette</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>In contrast to its French cousin,</strong>
                            the American omelette is often cooked until slightly
                            browned and is typically filled more generously.
                            It's usually folded in half and served flat. Popular
                            fillings include cheese, ham, onions, and peppers
                            &mdash; the "Denver omelette" is a classic example.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><h3>Spanish Tortilla (Tortilla Espa√±ola)</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>This iconic Spanish dish</strong> is a
                            thick, savory omelette made primarily with potatoes
                            and eggs. Onions are often included as well. It's
                            cooked slowly on both sides until set and is
                            typically served in wedges, either warm or cold.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><h3>Italian Frittata</h3></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>While similar to an omelette,</strong> the
                            frittata often incorporates the fillings directly
                            into the egg mixture before cooking. It's also
                            frequently finished in the oven, resulting in a
                            thicker, more substantial dish. Frittatas can
                            feature a wide variety of vegetables, cheeses, and
                            meats.

                        <dt><h3>Japanese Tamagoyaki</h3></dt>

                            prepared by cooking thin layers of seasoned egg in a
                            rectangular pan and rolling them up successively.
                            It's a common component of Japanese breakfast and
                            bento boxes.

                            typically containing chopped onions, green chilies,
                            coriander, and various spices. It's often served
                            with bread or as a side dish.
